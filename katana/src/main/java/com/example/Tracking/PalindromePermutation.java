     * For a given string, find whether or not a permutation of this string is a palindrome.

     * Strategy
     * [1] Traverse the input string starting from the first character.
     * [2] Populate a hash map with the characters in the string, along with the frequency of occurrence of each character.
     * [3] Traverse the hash map to get the count of characters with an odd number of occurrences.
     * [4] If the count exceeds 1, no palindromic permutation exists.
