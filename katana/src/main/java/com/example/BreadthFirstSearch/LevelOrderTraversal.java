     * Given the root of a binary tree, display the values of its nodes while performing a level order traversal. Return the node values for all levels in a string separated by the character :. 
     * If the tree is empty, i.e., the number of nodes is 0, then return “None” as the output.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] Declare two queues, currentQueue and nextQueue.
     * [2] Push the root node to currentQueue and set the level to zero.
     * [3] Dequeue the first element from currentQueue and push its children in nextQueue.
     * [4] If currentQueue is empty, increase the level number and swap the two queues.
     * [5] Repeat until currentQueue is empty.
