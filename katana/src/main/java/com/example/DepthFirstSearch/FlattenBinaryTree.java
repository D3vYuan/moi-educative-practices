    /**
     * Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to flatten the tree into a
     * linked list using the same TreeNode class.
     * The left child pointer of each node in the linked list should always be NULL,
     * and the right child pointer should point to the next node in the linked list.
     * The nodes in the linked list should be in the same order as that of the
     * preorder traversal of the given binary tree.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] For every node, check whether or not it has a left child. If it does not
     * have a left child, we move to the right child.
     * [2] Otherwise, find the node on the rightmost branch of the left subtree that
     * does not have a right child.
     * [3] Once we find this rightmost node, connect it with the right child of the
     * current node. After connecting, set the right child of the current node to
     * the left child of the current node.
     * [4] Finally, set the left child of the current node to NULL.
     * [5] Repeat the process until the given binary tree becomes flattened.
