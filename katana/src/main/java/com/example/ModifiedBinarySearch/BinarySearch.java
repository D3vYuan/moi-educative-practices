     * We are given an array of integers, nums, sorted in ascending order, and an integer value, target.

     * Strategy
     * [1] Find the middle element in the sorted array.
     * [2] Compare the middle element with the target element. If it matches, return the index of the element.
     * [3] If the target element is smaller than the middle element, perform the search on the left half of the array. Otherwise, perform the search on the right half of the array.
     * [4] Repeat the process until the target value is found. Otherwise, return -1 if not found.
