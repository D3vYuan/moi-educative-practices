    /**
     * Given a string, s, return the number of palindromic substrings contained in it. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string. 
     * A palindrome is a phrase, word, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] Initialize a count variable with 0.
     * [2] Because any string of length 1 is always a palindrome, start by counting the number of characters in the string and adding it to count.
     * [3] Check all two letter substrings to see if theyâ€™re palindromes, and update count accordingly.
     * [4] Using the results of the previous steps, increment count for any string of length greater than 2 if its first and last characters match, and the rest of the string is also a palindrome.
     * [5] Return the value of count, which represents the number of palindromic substrings in the given string.
