     * A recruiter plans to hire n people and conducts their interviews at two different locations of the company. He evaluates the cost of inviting candidates to both these locations. The plan is to invite 50% at one location, and the rest at the other location, keeping costs to a minimum.
     * We are given an array, costs, where  costs[i]=[aCosti,bCosti], 
     * the cost of inviting the ith person to City A is aCosti, and the cost of inviting the same person to City B is bCosti
     * You need to determine the minimum cost to invite all the candidates for the interview such that exactly n/2 people are invited in each city.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] Initialize a variable, total Cost to 0
     * [2] Sort the costs array in ascending order based on the difference between the cost of traveling to City A and City B
     * [3] Iterate over the sorted costs array.
     * [4] Add the cost of the first half of the array to invite to City A and the second half to invite to City B in totalCost
     * [5] Return totalCost after adding the respective costs
