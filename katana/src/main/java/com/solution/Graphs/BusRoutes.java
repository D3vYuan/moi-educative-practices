     * You are given an array, routes, representing bus routes where routes[i] is a
     * bus route that the ith bus repeats forever.
     * Every route contains one or more stations. You have also been given the
     * source station, src, and a destination station, dest.
     * Return the minimum number of buses someone must take to travel from src to
     * dest, or return -1 if there is no route.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] Create an adjacency list that maps each station to the buses that travel
     * through that station.
     * [2] Initialize a queue with a source station and the bus count.
     * [3] Iterate the queue either till it is empty or the destination station has
     * arrived.
     * [4] Visit connecting stations of the dequeued station, and enqueue connecting
     * stations.
     * [5] In every iteration, increase the bus count if a new bus is passing
     * through the same station.
     * [6] Return the bus count.
