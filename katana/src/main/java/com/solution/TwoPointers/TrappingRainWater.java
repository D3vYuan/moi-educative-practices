    /**
     * Given a sequence of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars in
     * an elevation map, the goal is to determine the amount of rainwater that can
     * be trapped between the bars after rain.
     * 
     * Strategy
     * [1] Initialize two pointers, left and right to iterate the given heights
     * array.
     * [2] Iterate the array and at each iteration, based on the lower maximum
     * height among the two sides, start computing the amount of rain water that can
     * be trapped.
     * [3] For each bar in the heights array, find the difference between the
     * maximum height of that side and the current barâ€™s height.
     * [4] Add this amount to the storedWater variable and update the maximum of the
     * respective side to ensure the correct calculations for the subsequent
     * iterations.
     * [5] Repeat this process until left becomes greater than right. Return the
     * cumulative sum stored in the storedWater variable.
